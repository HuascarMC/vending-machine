## What is it

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

This is the client side of a project that is currently being developed.

It simulates the usage of a vending machine but doesn't handle any of the logic. It works by making
requests on a RESTful API that runs on the server side.

Based on the response it renders what's necessary to simulate the operation of a vending machine.

#NOTE:
The server currently runs locally so running this by itself will only render the looks without any functionality.
Setup the ![server repo](https://github.com/HuascarMC/vending-machine-rest-api) too for functionality.
